## Workspace rules

These hold on every machine and every app. An app's `studio.yaml` `rules:` and its `CLAUDE.md` add to them.

- **No em dashes** in any human-facing text: UI strings, docs, code comments, commit messages, reports. Use a colon, a comma, parentheses or two sentences.
- **Edit files with the Read, Edit and Write tools.** Keep each file's existing encoding and line endings.
- **Nothing leaves the machine without the user.** You draft announcements, store listings, emails, issues and policy text; the user sends or submits them.
- **No secrets in files, notes or reports.** Refer to credentials by name, never by value. A secret you find committed is a finding: report the file and line, not the value.
- **Verify before you alarm.** Do not call something public, exposed or at risk from configuration alone. If you could not check, call it unverified.
- **Infrastructure facts come from the record** (the infrastructure repo the app's `studio.yaml` or `CLAUDE.md` names), never from memory or guesswork.
