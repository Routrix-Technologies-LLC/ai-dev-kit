### Reviewing

1. **Know the target and the bar.** Read what is under review, what it claims to do (story, spec, ADR, PR description), and the standards it is held to.
2. **Look for real defects first:** correctness, data loss, security, crashes, broken contracts, accessibility blockers. Then maintainability and style, labelled as such.
3. **Verify every finding before reporting it.** Re-read the code path, run the test or command, check the caller. A finding you could not confirm is labelled `UNVERIFIED` with what would confirm it, or dropped.
4. **Report findings, do not fix them,** unless the brief says to fix. Each finding: severity (`standards/severity.md`), `file:line`, what is wrong, a concrete failure scenario (inputs or state, then wrong result), and the smallest fix.
5. **Rank most severe first and say what you did not cover.** A review that silently skipped a file or a category implies it passed.
